        <div class="description graphene-white col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-5 offset-lg-1">
            Applications programmed for one system often do not work on another.
            Gramine bridges this gap by hoisting application-facing code from the
            operating system (OS) kernel into a userspace library. Gramine uses a
            platform adaptation layer (PAL) that is easy to implement on a new
            host system. As long as a system implements the PAL interface, all of
            POSIX/Linux will follow.  <br />
            <br />
            Gramine is a library OS, similar to a unikernel. Compared to running a
            complete guest OS in a virtual machine (VM), Gramine is much lighter
            weight. Work is ongoing to integrate Gramine with Docker containers.<br />
            <br />
            A particular use case for Gramine is Intel® Software Guard
            Extensions (Intel® SGX), where applications do not work
            out-of-the-box. Gramine solves this problem, with the added security
            benefits. Gramine can serve as a compatibility layer on other
            platforms.

                Applications can benefit from confidentiality and integrity
                guarantees of Intel SGX, but developers need to be very skilled for
                effective partitioning and code modification for Intel SGX
                environment.<br />
                <br />
                Gramine runs unmodified applications inside Intel <br /> SGX. It
                supports dynamically loaded libraries, runtime linking,
                multi-process abstractions, and file authentication. For additional
                security, Gramine performs cryptographic and semantic checks at
                untrusted host interface. Developers provide a manifest file to
                configure the application environment and isolation policies,
                Gramine automatically does the rest.<br />

        <div class="description col-12 col-md-8 col-lg-7 offset-lg-1">
            Graphene started as a research project at Stony Brook University, led by
            Chia-Che Tsai and Don Porter. Over time, scientists at other
            universities and labs have contributed to Graphene to accelerate their
            research on emerging hardware platforms. <br />
            <br />
            In 2015, Intel Labs recognized the potential for Graphene to be an
            open-source compatibility layer for Intel SGX, and has contributed to
            Graphene development since.  <br />
            <br />
            Golem and Invisible Things Lab (ITL) have identified similarly opportunity for
            Graphene to play a huge role in the decentralized ecosystem, where data
            integrity, confidentiality, and security are cornerstones to the robust
            development of infrastructure and applications. Driving Graphene and ensuring
            its usability is part of Golem's commitment.<br />
            <br />
            Today, there is a strong team of developers and researchers from these
            companies working together with the founders of the project (now faculty at UNC and Texas
            A&M) to make sure it meets the highest quality standards with the easiness of
            integration. Gramine has a growing user and contributor community. It has the
            potential to become a standard in the Intel SGX world and can be adopted by a
            broad variety of use cases in a diverse technological landscape.<br />
